#### Welcome to Genesis Engine Forked Version for UI Sub System

This is my website about a 3D engine I've made for the University for the Videogame's engine assignment. This engine is not entirely made by me, props to Marc Pagès Francesh, link for his Github -> <a href="Github">https://github.com/marcpages2020/GenesisEngine.</a></p>. I've focus on doing the UI sub-system.

To load the scene for this Assignment just go to file->load->scenes->main_menu.

# UI Sub System
## Main core Sub Systems
- Function: Stores all the functions that our UI elements will use.
- Font Importer: Used to load .ttf fonts and creates textures from the fonts.
- Module UI: Sets the render at Ortho and swaps again for prespective.
- Fade: Fade used between screens.
- UI Game Objects:
    - Button: 3 stats: Button On, Button Hover and Button Off, has a texture, stores position printed in the window and has a function to call when                       pressed.
    - Canvas: Parent of all the UI elements.
    - Checkbox: Like the button, with one child.
    - Image: Prints a texture.
    - RectTransform: Stores all the info about our UI elements; position, visibility, interactive, stay on mid,...
